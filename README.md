Recently, I have seen many projects based on #OpenAI. Each of us should have the ability to create these projects to solve our own problems.
I am preparing to create an AI platform that allows all users to use and create #ChatGPT small applications. Open source!
Progress will be tweeted in real time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EclipsePrayer), please like and follow!
